		"abstract": "Background. Obtaining fit-to-use data associated with diverse aspects of biodiversity, ecology and environment is challenging since often it is fragmented, sub-optimally managed and available in heterogeneous formats. Recently, with the universal acceptance of the FAIR data principles, the requirements and standards of data publications have changed substantially. Researchers are encouraged to manage the data as per the FAIR data principles and ensure that the raw data, metadata, processed data, software, codes and associated material are securely stored and the data be made available with the completion of the research. New information. We have developed BEXIS2 as an open-source community-driven web-based research data management system to support research data management needs of mid to large-scale research projects with multiple sub-projects and up to several hundred researchers. BEXIS2 is a modular and extensible system providing a range of functions to realise the complete data lifecycle from data structure design to data collection, data discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning. It is an extensible and customisable system that allows for the development of new functions and customisation of its various components from database schemas to the user interface layout, elements and look and feel. During the development of BEXIS2, we aimed to incorporate key aspects of what is encoded in FAIR data principles. To investigate the extent to which BEXIS2 conforms to these principles, we conducted the self-assessment using the FAIR indicators, definitions and criteria provided in the FAIR Data Maturity Model. Even though the FAIR data maturity model is developed initially to judge the conformance of datasets, the self-assessment results indicated that BEXIS2 remarkably conforms and supports FAIR indicators. BEXIS2 strongly conforms to the indicators Findability and Accessibility. The indicator Interoperability is moderately supported as of now; however, for many of the lesssupported facets, we have concrete plans for improvement. Reusability (as defined by the FAIR data principles) is partially achieved. This paper also illustrates community deployment examples of the BEXIS2 instances as success stories to exemplify its capacity to meet the biodiversity and ecological data management needs of differently sized projects and serve as an organisational research data management system.",

The software is being developed based on requirements from the biodiversity and ecology domain that mostly deal with tabular data, but it can be configured to serve other domains and data types as well. BEXIS 2 is very flexible and can be instantiated with multiple tenants, multiple metadata schemas, and various database systems. System features supporting the FAIR data principles are a faceted search (incl. primary data), a customizable data download and export (i.e., filter, sort, select, views), direct data access via API’s (e.g., from R), a highly flexible security system (incl. single sign-on), dataset versioning, and a dedicated management of data structures, variables and units of measures.",

		"abstract": "BEXIS 2 is an open source software for research data management in large scale projects with several hundred researchers. It has been designed to support the entire data life cycle during the active project phase. Requirements have been gathered from researchers in the biodiversity domain. However, it may serve other communities, too. In the Biodiversity domain a large portion of the data is collected in the field or laboratory and is structured as tabular data. Generic data management repositories (e.g. Fedora Repository, DSpace, ckan) mostly do not handle the internal structure of a dataset. With BEXIS 2 researchers are able to design, store and re-use data structures, which facilitates data discovery and data integration. In BEXIS 2 data structures of tabular data comprise any number of variables, which can be defined by a data type, a unit of measurement, and various other constraints. This precise definition strongly supports discoverability and reuse of data. Other advanced features of the current BEXIS 2 system are dataset versioning, management of multiple metadata schema, a faceted search and customizable data access (i.e. filter, sort, select, views), direct data access through APIs and a highly flexible security system (incl. single sign-on).",

		"abstract": "In the age of big data and data driven science, the ability to properly manage research data is a key competence any student in the sciences should acquire. Likewise, in order to be able to provide adequate software platforms, students of computer science need to learn about the requirements towards such systems from the domain scientists. In order to meet both requirements, in this semester, we combined two courses at our university: The class „Management of Scientific Data“ taught as part of our Masters‘ programs in Computer Science and in Computational and Data Science and an introductory class on geoinformatics for first year Bachelor students in Geography. The students jointly planned a field campaign to obtain vegetation data of a forest plot in the Roda valley close to Jena. The Management of Scientific Data students acted as coaches for the bachelor students, directly applying the knowledge on proper data collection and description in their lectures. They later on used the data for tasks on quality assurance and data analysis. The bachelor students were exposed to the topic of data management in a very early stage of their academic training. An important aspect is that the data collected was not just „toy data“, but data that is really needed in national and international research projects. The Roda Valley is a designated area for the validation of forest biomass by the European Space Agency. It is used intensively to test and develop new methods in remote sensing. The data collected by the students will serve as the necessary in situ data providing the ground truth. Based on the positive experience and feedback from this semester, we will extend this combination of classes next year. Students will work together not just in the planning of the field campaign but over the entire course of the semester. We also intend to include Ecology students. Their field work takes place in the same area – integrating their data would considerably increase the value of the data collected and the opportunities for analyses. With this, we hope to lay the foundation for the training of future data scientists with a background in either a domain science or computer science.",

The importance of data management is widely acknowledged by funding agencies and researchers alike. Technical solutions for all aspects of the data life cycle are available now. However, from our experiences with research communities in Germany, data management practices are only partially adopted into the scientific workflow and awareness of existing tools is often limited to some aspects, such as analysis or storage. Although there is a growing interest in data management issues and technical solutions, there still seems to be a gap between the technology available today and what is taken up by the scientific community.</p><p>In our presentation, we will discuss obstacles and shortcomings that lead to this conclusion. We will argue that to overcome these challenges, a threefold approach is necessary: First, the provision of suitable data management platforms for the ecological and biodiversity research community, second, training efforts to raise awareness and empower researchers to do proper data management, and third the establishment of organizational structures to support researchers.</p><p><b>Results/Conclusions </b></p><p>In the second part of our presentation, we highlight how we implement this threefold approach at our institution:</p><p>First, we spearhead the development of the BExIS 2 data management platform (http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/bexis). The aim is to provide a generic, scalable, and modular platform following the data life cycle concept. The system is based on a conceptual model and provides modules for data collection, discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning. Advanced features are dataset evolution (versioning) or views on variables of multiple datasets (spanning views). Overall, this development is a community driven effort supported by multiple projects at different research institutions. The user community is engaged through dedicated requirements and usability workshops.</p><p>Second, in addition to BExIS 2 specific training we conduct research data management workshops for PhD students (all disciplines), students of Computational science (M.Sc.), and students of ecology and geography (B.Sc., M.Sc.).</p><p>Third, we are in the process of establishing a helpdesk to provide support to all scientists of the University of Jena. This involves presentations to raise awareness on research data management topics, but also to assist members in creating data policies, data management plans, data publications and advise on long-term archiving.</p><p>These activities are partially funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and the Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena.</p>",

Therefore, there is a growing need to construct and develop platforms that enable scientists to capture, exchange, process, and interpret data for immediate use, as well as to store and manage data to support future reuse. Modeling and organizing data within such platforms are key challenges. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the dataset model of the BExIS 2 platform and how data can be organized inside the model. In particular, we describe the anatomy of a general purpose tabular dataset, which consists of data tuples to represent the table rows and data cells that are compound objects holding the obtained values and their auxiliary information. The structure of datasets is defined and applied separately in order to factor out shared concepts such as unit of measurement, methodology, data type, valid and missing values, processing functions and so on. The datasets are extensible in multiple ways and can be annotated on various levels utilizing taxonomies, ontologies, and custom metadata structures.",

BExIS 2 is the completely redesigned and refactored successor of the earlier Biodiversity Exploratories Information System (BExIS), which was established in 2007 as the data repository and information exchange platform for the Biodiversity Exploratories project (40+ sub-projects, 300+ researchers). Over the years BExIS has been adapted for additional large scale projects in functional biodiversity in Germany (e.g. Jena Experiment, Kilimanjaro, EFForTS). With the growing community not only the list of requested features rose, also the demand for a more flexible and easier to instantiate system grew. In 2011 we started to revamp the system based on a newly designed architecture to be more generic and meet modern software standards in terms of scalability, modularity and interoperability.
