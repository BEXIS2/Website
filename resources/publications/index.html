   <i>RDA 10th Plenary Meeting, Montreal, Canada, 2017-09-19</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->BEXIS 2 is a modular, scalable, interoperable, free and open source system supporting large research consortia on all aspects of data life cycle management. The software is being developed based on requirements from the biodiversity and ecology domain that mostly deal with tabular data, but it can be configured to serve other domains and data types as well. BEXIS 2 is very flexible and can be instantiated with multiple tenants, multiple metadata schemas, and various database systems. System features supporting the FAIR data principles are a faceted search (incl. primary data), a customizable data download and export (i.e., filter, sort, select, views), direct data access via API’s (e.g., from R), a highly flexible security system (incl. single sign-on), dataset versioning, and a dedicated management of data structures, variables and units of measures.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>

   <i>SciDataCon 2016, International Data Week, Denver, CO, USA, 2016-09-13</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->BEXIS 2 is an open source software for research data management in large scale projects with several hundred researchers. It has been designed to support the entire data life cycle during the active project phase. Requirements have been gathered from researchers in the biodiversity domain. However, it may serve other communities, too. In the Biodiversity domain a large portion of the data is collected in the field or laboratory and is structured as tabular data. Generic data management repositories (e.g. Fedora Repository, DSpace, ckan) mostly do not handle the internal structure of a dataset. With BEXIS 2 researchers are able to design, store and re-use data structures, which facilitates data discovery and data integration. In BEXIS 2 data structures of tabular data comprise any number of variables, which can be defined by a data type, a unit of measurement, and various other constraints. This precise definition strongly supports discoverability and reuse of data. Other advanced features of the current BEXIS 2 system are dataset versioning, management of multiple metadata schema, a faceted search and customizable data access (i.e. filter, sort, select, views), direct data access through APIs and a highly flexible security system (incl. single sign-on).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>

BEXIS is being developed to address the data management needs of large scale research projects with multiple sub-projects and several hundred researchers. Following the data-life-cycle concept BEXIS 2 provides modules for data collection, data discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning.

  <div class="publication-preview svelte-8jiqct"><h2 class="svelte-8jiqct">Teaching Biodiversity Data Management to Computer Science and Geography Students – An Experience Report</h2>
   <i>TDWG Conference 2015, Nairobi, Kenya, 2015-09-28</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the age of big data and data driven science, the ability to properly manage research data is a key competence any student in the sciences should acquire. Likewise, in order to be able to provide adequate software platforms, students of computer science need to learn about the requirements towards such systems from the domain scientists. In order to meet both requirements, in this semester, we combined two courses at our university: The class „Management of Scientific Data“ taught as part of our Masters‘ programs in Computer Science and in Computational and Data Science and an introductory class on geoinformatics for first year Bachelor students in Geography. The students jointly planned a field campaign to obtain vegetation data of a forest plot in the Roda valley close to Jena. The Management of Scientific Data students acted as coaches for the bachelor students, directly applying the knowledge on proper data collection and description in their lectures. They later on used the data for tasks on quality assurance and data analysis. The bachelor students were exposed to the topic of data management in a very early stage of their academic training. An important aspect is that the data collected was not just „toy data“, but data that is really needed in national and international research projects. The Roda Valley is a designated area for the validation of forest biomass by the European Space Agency. It is used intensively to test and develop new methods in remote sensing. The data collected by the students will serve as the necessary in situ data providing the ground truth. Based on the positive experience and feedback from this semester, we will extend this combination of classes next year. Students will work together not just in the planning of the field campaign but over the entire course of the semester. We also intend to include Ecology students. Their field work takes place in the same area – integrating their data would considerably increase the value of the data collected and the opportunities for analyses. With this, we hope to lay the foundation for the training of future data scientists with a background in either a domain science or computer science.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>

   <i>Ecological Society of America - Annual Meeting 2015, Baltimore, USA, 2015-08-13</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p><b>Background/Question/Methods</b><b> </b></p><p>Over the past decade data management in ecology and biodiversity has seen a proliferation of concepts, standards, software tools, and data infrastructures. The importance of data management is widely acknowledged by funding agencies and researchers alike. Technical solutions for all aspects of the data life cycle are available now. However, from our experiences with research communities in Germany, data management practices are only partially adopted into the scientific workflow and awareness of existing tools is often limited to some aspects, such as analysis or storage. Although there is a growing interest in data management issues and technical solutions, there still seems to be a gap between the technology available today and what is taken up by the scientific community.</p><p>In our presentation, we will discuss obstacles and shortcomings that lead to this conclusion. We will argue that to overcome these challenges, a threefold approach is necessary: First, the provision of suitable data management platforms for the ecological and biodiversity research community, second, training efforts to raise awareness and empower researchers to do proper data management, and third the establishment of organizational structures to support researchers.</p><p><b>Results/Conclusions </b></p><p>In the second part of our presentation, we highlight how we implement this threefold approach at our institution:</p><p>First, we spearhead the development of the BExIS 2 data management platform (http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/bexis). The aim is to provide a generic, scalable, and modular platform following the data life cycle concept. The system is based on a conceptual model and provides modules for data collection, discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning. Advanced features are dataset evolution (versioning) or views on variables of multiple datasets (spanning views). Overall, this development is a community driven effort supported by multiple projects at different research institutions. The user community is engaged through dedicated requirements and usability workshops.</p><p>Second, in addition to BExIS 2 specific training we conduct research data management workshops for PhD students (all disciplines), students of Computational science (M.Sc.), and students of ecology and geography (B.Sc., M.Sc.).</p><p>Third, we are in the process of establishing a helpdesk to provide support to all scientists of the University of Jena. This involves presentations to raise awareness on research data management topics, but also to assist members in creating data policies, data management plans, data publications and advise on long-term archiving.</p><p>These activities are partially funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and the Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>

   <i>The International Symposium on Challenges for Designing and Using Datasets (DATASETS 2015), June 21 - 26, 2015 - Brussels, Belgium, Brussels, Belgium, 2015-06-01</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There is a proliferation of datasets generated by various scientists of different scientific disciplines. Therefore, there is a growing need to construct and develop platforms that enable scientists to capture, exchange, process, and interpret data for immediate use, as well as to store and manage data to support future reuse. Modeling and organizing data within such platforms are key challenges. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the dataset model of the BExIS 2 platform and how data can be organized inside the model. In particular, we describe the anatomy of a general purpose tabular dataset, which consists of data tuples to represent the table rows and data cells that are compound objects holding the obtained values and their auxiliary information. The structure of datasets is defined and applied separately in order to factor out shared concepts such as unit of measurement, methodology, data type, valid and missing values, processing functions and so on. The datasets are extensible in multiple ways and can be annotated on various levels utilizing taxonomies, ontologies, and custom metadata structures.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>

   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Managing research data throughout the entire ecological data‐life‐cycle has been a challenge and an active research field in applied computer science for more than a decade. Specialized tools to handle individual components of the data‐life‐cycle do exist in great variety. However, the availability of frameworks connecting components for data creation, quality assurance, data processing, data publication, and data discovery is limited, thus hampering efficient scientific work flows. In order to address these issues we follow a threefold approach: first, we develop the technical infrastructure, namely the data management platform BExIS 2; second, we try to improve data literacy and data management skills of individual researchers and students; third, we try to enhance administrative and institutional conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building on the legacy of the Biodiversity Exploratories Information System (BExIS) the BExIS++ project was initiated in 2011 to advance the existing BExIS system in terms of scalability, modularity and interoperability, but also to better support the data-life-cycle management. Based on a new conceptual model and application architecture, the new BExIS 2 platform is being developed as a generic biodiversity data repository providing modules for data collection, discovery, dissemination, integration, quality assurance and research planning. Key features of the current BExIS 2.4.0 system include: support for a broad range of data structures and data types, support for multiple database management systems (e.g. PostgreSQL, IBM DB2), a faceted search on metadata and primary data, customizable data downloads and a highly flexible security system.

The current user community comprises a number of large scale research projects that adapted the original BExIS system (e.g. Jena Experiment, Kilimanjaro, EFForTS) and are expected to migrate, as well as projects that implement and contribute to the new BExIS 2 system (e.g. iDiv, AquaDiva, GFBio).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the technical development we investigate how undergraduate, graduate and PhD students can be trained more effectively on research data management and data-life-cycle issues. For example, we conducted a workshop “Research Data Management – Make your Data count!” for PhD students at the Graduate Academy at the University of Jena. Lectures for undergraduate students are in preparation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Along the third theme we work towards raising awareness on general research data management aspects at the university level.

   <i>TDWG Annual Conference, Jönköping, Sweden, 2014-10-01</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In this demonstration we will introduce the BExIS 2 research data management platform. BExIS 2 is the completely redesigned and refactored successor of the earlier Biodiversity Exploratories Information System (BExIS), which was established in 2007 as the data repository and information exchange platform for the Biodiversity Exploratories project (40+ sub-projects, 300+ researchers). Over the years BExIS has been adapted for additional large scale projects in functional biodiversity in Germany (e.g. Jena Experiment, Kilimanjaro, EFForTS). With the growing community not only the list of requested features rose, also the demand for a more flexible and easier to instantiate system grew. In 2011 we started to revamp the system based on a newly designed architecture to be more generic and meet modern software standards in terms of scalability, modularity and interoperability.

   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In fields like Ecology, Biology or Geoscience research relies fundamentally on data gathered in the field or the laboratory by humans or autonomous sensors. However, according to Reichman et al. (2011, DOI:<i> 10.1126/science.1197962</i>) “…less than 1% of the ecological data collected is accessible after publication of associated results.” Although this estimated number may have increased slightly by now due to numerous initiatives dealing with the technological, organizational, and sociological challenges here, effective research data management is still not an integral part of the science workflow for many researchers.</p><p>Despite being involved also in developing technological solution to the problem, in this presentation we will focus only on activities towards education and training of students and young scientists. We would like to share and discuss our experiences in developing and implementing training courses on research data management.</p><p>In order to create a general awareness on data management issues as early as possible we develop single lectures for B.Sc. and M.Sc. students, which can be included into existing modules without interfering to much with the existing curricular.</p><p>Besides educating students in ecology or related discipline it is also important to train computer science students on research data management.&nbsp; Here we will develop an entire module as part of the Computational and Data Science Master at FSU.</p><p>In June 2014 we will conduct a 1-day workshop “Research data management – make your data count!” at the Graduate Academy of the Friedrich-Schiller-University.</p><p>With more data management software becoming available, there is a need to offer hands-on training courses on these tools.

While much recent research and development have focused on specialized languages and tools to fulfill the requirements of specific domains or data structures, the need for more general technologies to enable data scientists to deal with various forms of data in a universal manner is growing. In this paper we describe data querying capabilities of the XQt language in order to show how it enables the users to author their processes in data source and format ignorant ways and to share and reuse their data, processes, and acquired skills. In addition, we describe the internals of the language, the execution pipeline, and the mapping between the domain level schemas and the physical structure of the data.

   <i>, Journal of Ecological Informatics, 2013-12-01</i>
   <div class="abstract preview svelte-8jiqct"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Conceptual models play an  important role in identifying the domain under study and establishing an  interoperability framework between different scientific groups and  tools working on the same or neighboring domains. The importance comes  from the fact that the conceptual models describe the target domain in a  technology agnostic manner, using domain terminology, considerations,  and rules.</p><p >In this paper we introduce a  highly flexible data and metadata structure for biodiversity (and  related fields) information management. The model incorporates important  concepts needed to develop a proper domain model for managing  biodiversity data, e.g., data, data structure, metadata, metadata  structure, and semantic descriptions of model elements. The model is  designed in UML using the object oriented analysis paradigms. The data  management teams of several large collaborative projects as well as  those of two research institutes were actively cooperating in the design  of the model, thus ensuring that all aspects relevant for these very  different projects and institutions are considered and that a high  acceptance of the model will ensue.</p><p>The model supports and  encourages reuse and sharing of different elements, making the cross  dataset syntheses, comparison, merging and searches easier. The  incorporated semantic package helps to annotate dataset s variables and  metadata attributes by means of ontologies, taxonomies or thesauri.  These annotations can be used for standardization, localization and also  for managing the variety of meanings of same or similar variables among  community members.</p><p>The model is currently  undergoing its implementation phase and will replace the model used in  the current version of BExIS, a data management platform for  biodiversity research, when finished.</p><p></p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>
