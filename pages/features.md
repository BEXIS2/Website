# Features
 
BEXIS 2 is a free and open source software (LGPL 3.0) supporting researchers in managing their data throughout the entire data life cycle from data collection, documentation, processing, analyzing, to sharing and publishing research data.

BEXIS 2 is a modular scalable platform suitable for working groups and collaborative project consortia with up to several hundred researchers. It has been designed to meet the requirements of researchers in the field of biodiversity, but it is generic enough to serve other communities as well.
